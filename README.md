<b> Title: </b> This is a Blockchain-Enabled Sensor Framework that uses Augmented Reality and Artificial Intelligence. <br>
<b> Sample Project: </b> Planter AI was created to inspire you while offering additional source code plus notes. <br>
<b> Compatibility: </b> This framework can use any 3rd party Analogue or Digital Sensor that's compatible with Ardunio. <br>
<b>This Repo is 1 of 2 phases. </b> The next phase will publish around Oct 01 2021.


Phase 1.0

1. We've Developed a Sensor Reading Application (Python - Raspberry Pi)

2. Stored the Python - Raspberry Pi data into Google Firebase through Python API's

3. Collected Data from Firebase and Displayed it in Unity Mobile Application

4. Displayed that Data on your Static IP Address from Firebase. 


Phase 2.0

{Subject : Mobile Apps Development & Uploading them on snapcraft.io, The App Store, and Google Play using Augmented & Virtual Reality (AR & VR), AWS (Amazon Web Server & Services) & BlockChain} *Contact us for specifics using support@wolfberryllc.com otherwise we will reveal all source code + notes around Oct 01 2021
